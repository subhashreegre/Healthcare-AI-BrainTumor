## Brain Tumor Detection using MRI ðŸ§ ðŸŽ¯
Brain Tumor Detection using MRI is an AI-powered project that uses deep learning techniques to automatically detect brain tumors from MRI scans. This tool aids in the early detection of tumors, providing healthcare professionals with an efficient and accurate means to diagnose brain abnormalities.

# Features
- Brain Tumor Detection: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.
- Segmentation and Masking: Applies AI to segment and highlight areas of the brain affected by tumors.
- Automated Diagnosis: Provides an initial diagnosis and localization of tumors, aiding radiologists in faster decision-making.
- Visual Superimposition: Overlays tumor regions on MRI scans to visually highlight areas of concern for the medical team.

# Why Use This AI Tool?
**High Accuracy:** The deep learning model has been trained on a large dataset of MRI images to identify tumors with high accuracy.
**Fast and Efficient:** Reduces the time needed to analyze MRI scans, improving workflow for radiologists and doctors.
**Accessible:** Helps make brain tumor detection more accessible, especially in regions where specialized medical professionals may be scarce.
**Assistive Tool:** Supports, but does not replace, human decision-making. The AI results should be reviewed by a healthcare professional.

# Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection-mri.git
- cd brain-tumor-detection-mri

2. Install the required dependencies:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the pre-trained model or train your own using the provided dataset and scripts.

4. Run the model on an MRI image to detect brain tumors.

# Model Architecture
The project utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to process MRI images and detect tumors. The model is trained on labeled MRI datasets (e.g., the Brain Tumor Dataset) to learn patterns and features specific to tumor regions in brain scans. It uses **Resnet50** as a parent model for transfer learning.

# Use Cases
**Early Diagnosis:** Automates the detection of brain tumors, helping clinicians diagnose issues earlier.
**Tumor Localization:** Visualizes the location and size of brain tumors, assisting with planning treatment options.
**Medical Research:** Can be used as a research tool to analyze and detect abnormalities in large sets of MRI data.

# Example Output
*Input:* MRI scan image of the brain.
*Output:* A heatmap or highlighted region where the tumor is located, along with the classification (e.g., benign or malignant).
